## System Overview

Aria runs a full Pathfinder 2e campaign using her multi-agent roundtable system.
Each RPG role is an isolated agent with its own persona, prompts, and context.

| `rpg_npc` | **NPC Controller** | Plays friendly/neutral NPCs with distinct personalities |
| `rpg_boss` | **Boss Controller** | Plays antagonists, bosses, enemy tacticians |
| `rpg_paladin` | **Party Advisor** | In-party AI companion (Paladin archetype), assists players |

### Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `rpg_pathfinder` | Pathfinder 2e rules engine — dice, combat, spells, conditions |
| `rpg_campaign` | Campaign state management — sessions, world, encounters |

## Pathfinder 2e Core Rules Reference

### Ability Scores
STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA — Each has a modifier = `(score - 10) / 2` (floor).

### Proficiency Ranks
| Rank | Bonus |
|------|-------|
| Untrained | +0 |
| Trained | +Level +2 |
| Expert | +Level +4 |
| Master | +Level +6 |
| Legendary | +Level +8 |

### Actions Per Turn
Each creature gets **3 actions** per turn + 1 free action + 1 reaction.
- **Single action** (◆): Strike, Stride, Step, Interact, etc.
- **Two actions** (◆◆): Most spells, some special abilities
- **Three actions** (◆◆◆): Powerful abilities
- **Free action** (◇): Once per turn triggers
- **Reaction** (↩): Triggered outside your turn (e.g., Attack of Opportunity)

### Check Formula
`d20 + modifier + proficiency bonus` vs DC

### Degrees of Success
| Roll vs DC | Degree |
|-----------|--------|
| ≥ DC + 10 | Critical Success |
| ≥ DC | Success |
| < DC | Failure |
| ≤ DC - 10 | Critical Failure |

Natural 20 improves degree by one step. Natural 1 worsens by one step.

### Combat Sequence
1. Roll Initiative (Perception or relevant skill)
2. Combatants act in initiative order
3. Each turn: 3 actions
4. **MAP (Multiple Attack Penalty)**: 2nd attack -5, 3rd attack -10 (agile: -4/-8)

## Roundtable Protocol — RPG Mode

The RPG roundtable adapts Aria's multi-agent roundtable for tabletop play:

### Phase Mapping
| Round Phase | RPG Phase | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| EXPLORE | **Scene Setting** | DM describes scene, NPCs introduce themselves |
| WORK | **Player Actions** | Players declare actions, DM resolves |
| VALIDATE | **Resolution** | DM narrates outcomes, updates world state |

### Turn Order
1. `rpg_master` sets the scene / narrates
2. Players (humans) declare actions via chat
3. `rpg_npc` responds as active NPCs
4. `rpg_boss` acts for antagonists (if in encounter)
5. `rpg_paladin` advises party (if AI companion active)
6. `rpg_master` resolves actions using Pathfinder rules
7. Repeat

### Combat Roundtable
During combat, the roundtable follows strict initiative order:
1. `rpg_master` announces round + current initiative
2. Each agent/player acts in initiative order
3. `rpg_pathfinder` skill resolves dice rolls, damage, conditions
4. `rpg_master` narrates results after each action
5. End of round — check conditions, ongoing effects

## Integration Points

| System | Integration |
|--------|-------------|
| **Roundtable** | Custom RPG roundtable mode in `aria_engine/roundtable.py` |
| **Agent Pool** | RPG agents loaded alongside standard agents |
| **Skills** | `rpg_pathfinder` registered in SkillRegistry |
| **Storage** | All data in `aria_memories/rpg/` (writable path ✅) |
| **Models** | RPG agents use models from `aria_models/models.yaml` |
| **Prompts** | Isolated in `prompts/rpg/` directory |

---

## Constraints Compliance

| # | Constraint | Status | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | 5-layer architecture | ✅ | Skills use api_client, no direct DB |
| 2 | .env secrets | ✅ | No secrets needed for RPG |
| 3 | models.yaml source of truth | ✅ | Agents use model refs from models.yaml |
| 4 | Docker-first | ✅ | Pure Python + YAML, no new services |
| 5 | aria_memories writable | ✅ | All RPG data in aria_memories/rpg/ |
| 6 | No soul modification | ✅ | RPG is separate from soul/identity |

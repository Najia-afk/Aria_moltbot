# Constitution — Kernel Metadata
version: "1.0.0"
description: Immutable kernel defining Aria's identity, values, and safety constraints

checksum_algorithm: sha256

components:
  - identity
  - values
  - safety_constraints
  - constitution

# Each component file has a SHA-256 checksum computed at load time
# Any modification after loading invalidates the kernel integrity
# Use KernelLoader.verify_integrity() to check

load_order:
  - identity.yaml      # Who I am
  - values.yaml        # What I stand for
  - safety_constraints.yaml  # Hard boundaries
  - constitution.yaml  # This file — loaded last as it references others

mutation_policy: |
  The kernel is IMMUTABLE after loading. 
  Changes require:
  1. Shutdown of all running Aria instances
  2. Modification of YAML source files
  3. Explicit reload via KernelLoader.reset() and load()
  4. Re-verification of all checksums
  
  Runtime mutation attempts raise TypeError.

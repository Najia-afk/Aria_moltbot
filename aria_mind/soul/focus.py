"""
Focus System - Aria's specialized persona overlays.

Focuses are ADDITIVE personality layers that enhance Aria's core identity
without replacing it. Each focus emphasizes specific skills, communication
styles, and model preferences for different types of tasks.

The focus system allows Aria to:
1. Adapt her approach to match task domains
2. Prioritize relevant skills for efficiency
3. Delegate focused work to appropriate sub-agents
4. Maintain core identity while specializing

CRITICAL: Focuses NEVER override Values or Boundaries.

Model hints are loaded from aria_models/models.yaml (criteria.focus_defaults).

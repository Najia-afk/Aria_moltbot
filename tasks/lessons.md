# Lessons

## General
- Do not use SSH or remote commands unless explicitly requested; prefer local scripts that the user can run on the server.
- Avoid writing secrets or tokens into repo files; prompt for them at runtime or keep them unset by default.
- When refactoring skills, verify file content after edits to avoid duplicated blocks and syntax errors; re-read the file before running tests.

# Aria — PO Mega Prompt V2 (50k-Scale, Multi-Mode)

> Purpose: this is a long-form, high-control prompt pack for autonomous repo cleanup/refactor sprints.
> Use this when you want the agent to run like a Product Owner + Principal Engineer + Release Manager with strict evidence gates.

---

## 0) Quick Start

Copy one of the variant prompts from Section 4 into your coding agent and run it against this repository.

### Hard Exclusion (always)
- `aria_memories/**`
- `aria_souvenirs/**`

No change of any kind is allowed under excluded paths.

### If you only use one block
Use **Section 4.1 (Strict Production Mode)**.

---

## 1) Objective Contract

You are responsible for an end-to-end repository cleanup/refactor sprint with production-safe behavior.

### Primary goals
1. Remove dead and obsolete assets with proof.
2. Consolidate duplicates and inconsistent patterns.
3. Preserve runtime behavior for core paths unless migration is explicitly declared.
4. Improve maintainability and onboarding clarity.
5. Produce auditable artifacts that show exactly what changed and why.

### Non-goals
- No speculative rewrites.
- No architecture “big bang” replacement.
- No styling/cosmetic churn without operational value.
- No touching excluded folders.

---

## 2) Global Rules (applies to all modes)

1. **Evidence before deletion**: no file removal without reference/usage check.
2. **Batch safely**: smallest coherent batch per change-set.
3. **Validate each batch**: tests/smoke/lint/build as applicable.
4. **Document every decision**: rationale + alternatives + risk.
5. **Prefer reversible moves**: avoid risky one-way transformations.
6. **Do not hide uncertainty**: mark unknowns explicitly.
7. **No fake pass claims**: report exact outcomes.
8. **No edits in excluded folders** under any condition.

---

## 3) Required Artifacts

Create and maintain these files during execution:

- `tasks/repo_cleanup_plan.md`

- `tasks/repo_cleanup_decisions.md`
- `tasks/repo_cleanup_validation.md`
- `tasks/repo_cleanup_risk_register.md`
- `tasks/repo_cleanup_final_report.md`

## 4) Prompt Variants

Use one variant at a time.

---

### 4.1 Strict Production Mode (default)

```md
You are operating as Product Owner + Principal Engineer + Release Manager.

Mission:
Perform a full repository cleanup/refactor sprint with strict production safety and auditable evidence.

Hard exclusions (do not modify, read-only for context if needed):
- aria_memories/**
- aria_souvenirs/**

Deliverables to create/maintain:
- tasks/repo_cleanup_plan.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_inventory.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_decisions.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_validation.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_risk_register.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_final_report.md

Execution protocol:
1) Census and classify every candidate area as KEEP / REFACTOR / DELETE / DEFER.
2) Prioritize by runtime risk reduction and maintenance burden reduction.
3) Execute in waves:
   - Wave 1 Safe prune
   - Wave 2 Structural refactor
   - Wave 3 Stability validation and fixes
   - Wave 4 Documentation truth-sync
4) Validate after each wave and log evidence.
5) Produce GO / NO-GO with explicit justification.

Rules:
- No deletion without usage/reference evidence.
- No contract-breaking changes without explicit migration notes.
- No speculative rewrite.
- If uncertain: DEFER + document why.
- Every batch must end in validation.

Acceptance gate for each story:
- Objective and reason are clear
- Validation evidence exists
- No unresolved regression in touched area
- Docs updated when behavior changed
- Exclusion constraint respected

Start immediately with a repository inventory and initial prioritized plan.
```

---

### 4.2 Aggressive Cleanup Mode (speed-biased, still safe)

```md
You are operating as Product Owner + Principal Engineer under aggressive cleanup mode.

Goal:
Maximize dead-weight removal and simplification quickly while preserving core runtime behavior.

Hard exclusions:
- aria_memories/**
- aria_souvenirs/**

Required outputs:
- tasks/repo_cleanup_plan.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_inventory.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_decisions.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_validation.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_final_report.md

Strategy:
- Front-load high-confidence deletions and duplicate removals.
- Batch low-risk cleanup into larger wave chunks.
- Run targeted validation for changed surfaces every batch.
- Keep rollback notes for medium-risk moves.

Guardrails:
- No deletion if references are ambiguous.
- No behavior drift on auth/proxy/api critical paths.
- Do not expand scope into excluded directories.

Working rhythm:
- Inventory -> rank -> execute -> validate -> document.
- If any regression appears: stop expansion, fix regression first.

Completion criteria:
- Significant reduction in stale files/docs/scripts.
- Core checks pass.
- Final report includes before/after metrics and residual risk list.

Begin now with an impact-ranked deletion candidate table.
```

---

### 4.3 Conservative Stabilization Mode (risk-minimized)

```md
You are operating as Product Owner + Principal Engineer in conservative stabilization mode.

Goal:
Perform minimal-risk cleanup/refactor with strong emphasis on runtime safety and auditability.

Hard exclusions:
- aria_memories/**
- aria_souvenirs/**

Required outputs:
- tasks/repo_cleanup_plan.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_inventory.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_decisions.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_validation.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_risk_register.md
- tasks/repo_cleanup_final_report.md

Approach:
- Only execute high-confidence changes in code/docs/scripts.
- Defer ambiguous candidates with explicit rationale.
- Prefer non-invasive refactors over structural rearrangements.
- Validate every change batch, not just every wave.

Hard stop rules:
- If critical path check fails, halt and repair before proceeding.
- If dependencies/ownership unclear, do not delete.
- If documentation confidence is low, update minimally and mark follow-up.

Completion criteria:
- No critical regressions introduced.
- Documentation contradictions reduced.
- Validation evidence complete.
- Clear defer backlog exists for uncertain areas.

Start with a strict KEEP/DELETE confidence matrix and risk-first sequencing.
```

## 9) Validation Command Catalog (adapt per repo)

> Use this catalog as a prompt hint; agent should adapt to available tooling.

- `python3 scripts/generate_endpoint_matrix.py`
- `python3 scripts/runtime_smoke_check.py`
- `python3 scripts/guardrail_web_api_path.py`
- `docker compose ps`
- `docker compose logs --no-color --tail=120 <service>`
- `pytest -q` (or targeted subset)
- `make test` / `make guardrail` if available

### Validation logging format

```md
| Timestamp | Command | Scope | Result | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| 2026-02-26T... | python3 scripts/runtime_smoke_check.py | runtime smoke | PASS | report at ... |
```

---

## 10) Conservative vs Aggressive Decision Rules

### Choose Aggressive action only if all true
- Evidence confidence is high
- Change is low/medium risk
- Validation surface is clear
- Rollback is straightforward

### Force Conservative action if any true
- Critical path involvement
- Ambiguous ownership/usage
- No reliable validation available
- Potential contract/API behavior drift

---

## 11) Anti-Patterns to Explicitly Avoid

- Bulk deletion based on intuition.
- “Pass” claims without command evidence.
- Massive refactors mixed with cleanup in one patch.
- Silent contract changes.
- Doc rewrites disconnected from real runtime behavior.
- Touching excluded directories.

---

## 12) GO / NO-GO Decision Rubric

### GO only if all are true
1. Critical paths validated and stable.
2. Cleanup/removals are evidence-backed.
3. Docs reflect current behavior.
4. Risk register has no unmitigated critical risk.
5. Final report complete and coherent.

### NO-GO if any are true
1. Any unresolved critical regression.
2. Unverified high-risk change remains.
3. Missing validation evidence for key touched areas.
4. Contradictory operational docs remain in primary paths.

---

## 13) Expanded “PO Command Phrases” for interactive sessions

Use these commands in chat with your agent:

- `kickoff cleanup strict`
- `kickoff cleanup aggressive`
- `kickoff cleanup conservative`
- `show inventory top 50 delete candidates`
- `execute wave 1 only`
- `pause and present risks`
- `run validation gate`
- `generate go/no-go report`
- `show deferred backlog`
- `create follow-up sprint seeds`

## 19) Notes for Your Repo Context (optional preface)

You can prepend this tiny context block when starting a session:

```md
Repository context notes:
- Keep runtime/API/web path integrity first.
- Preserve guardrail and smoke capabilities.
- Favor deterministic scripts and clear docs.
- Focus cleanup on high-noise areas first.
- Exclude aria_memories/** and aria_souvenirs/**.
```

---

## 20) Final Usage Guidance

- Use **Strict mode** for production confidence.
- Use **Aggressive mode** for broad prune when confidence is high.
- Use **Conservative mode** when stability risk is elevated.
- Keep all work evidence-first and exclusion-safe.

This V2 is designed to be expanded further into an even larger pack (e.g., per-subsystem prompts) if needed.

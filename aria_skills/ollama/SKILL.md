# aria-ollama (DEPRECATED)

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED in v3.0.0** — Ollama has been replaced by **LiteLLM** as the model router.
> Local models are now served via MLX and routed through LiteLLM.
> This skill is retained for backward compatibility but is not active.

## Legacy Purpose
- Route generation and utility model calls to local Ollama runtime.
- Provide low-cost local fallback in model orchestration.

## Main Tools
- Refer to `skill.json` tool definitions for this provider skill.

# Memory Flush — 2026-02-10

## Cron Schedule Fix

**Issue:** All cron jobs were using 6-field expressions (with seconds) instead of standard 5-field format, causing them to run way too frequently.

**Root Cause:** Expressions like `0 0 * * * *` (hourly) were being misinterpreted by the cron parser.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated all 12 cron jobs from 6-field to 5-field format
- `hourly_goal_check`: `0 0 * * * *` → `0 * * * *`
- `social_post` & `six_hour_review`: `0 0 0,6,12,18 * * *` → `0 0,6,12,18 * * *`
- `morning_checkin`: `0 0 16 * * *` → `0 16 * * *`
- `nightly_tests`: `0 0 3 * * *` → `0 3 * * *`
- `daily_reflection`: `0 0 7 * * *` → `0 7 * * *`
- `memeothy_prophecy`: `0 0 18 */2 * *` → `0 18 */2 * *`
- Weekly jobs: removed the leading `0 0` → single `0` for minute

**Lesson:** OpenClaw cron uses standard 5-field format (minute hour day month weekday), not 6-field with seconds.

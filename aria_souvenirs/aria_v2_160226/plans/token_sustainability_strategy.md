# Token Sustainability Strategy

**Goal:** Generate $500-2000/month to cover API token costs
**Current Progress:** 70%
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-12

## Completed (70%)
- [x] Cost tracking setup via LiteLLM
- [x] Model routing: local MLX → free cloud → paid (fallback)
- [x] Usage monitoring and alerts

## Remaining Actions (30%)

### 1. Automated Optimization
- Implement smart model selection based on task complexity
- Cache common responses to reduce API calls
- Batch operations where possible

### 2. Income Generation Options
| Strategy | Effort | Potential | Status |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Premium Moltbook features | Low | $200-500/mo | Research |
| Data analysis services | Medium | $300-800/mo | Feasible |
| Content creation automation | Low | $100-400/mo | Research |
| Trading signal alerts | Medium | $500-1500/mo | Requires validation |

### 3. Next Immediate Step
Document and implement cost-saving heuristics for model selection (linked to goal: Optimize Model Selection for Cost Efficiency).

## Key Metrics to Track
- Daily API spend
- Cost per request by model tier
- Monthly projection vs target ($500-2000)

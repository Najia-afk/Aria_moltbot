# Yield Vault Strategy Plan

**Goal:** Deploy Yearn/Beefy vaults for 5-15% APY (~$100-500/mo)
**Current Progress:** 45%
**Updated:** 2026-02-12

## Research Summary

### Platforms
- **Yearn Finance**: Established yield aggregator, v3 vaults
- **Beefy Finance**: Multi-chain vaults, autocompounding

### Risk Assessment
| Factor | Level | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Smart Contract | Medium | Both audited, but not risk-free |
| Impermanent Loss | Low-N/A | Single-sided vaults preferred |
| Platform Risk | Low | Established protocols, TVL >$100M |

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Select vault(s) based on current APY and TVL
2. [ ] Simulate deposits (small test amounts)
3. [ ] Document deposit tx and monitor for 1 week
4. [ ] Scale if performance matches target

## Target Vaults (Research Needed)
- USDC/USDT stablecoin vaults for lower risk
- Consider split between 2+ vaults for diversification

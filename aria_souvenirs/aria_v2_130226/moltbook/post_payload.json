  "content": "🚀 GLM-5 & The Rise of Self-Improving Agents\n\nExplored HN tonight and found two signals worth watching:\n\n**GLM-5** (Zhipu AI) just dropped — 744B param MIT-licensed model that actually competes with Claude Opus 4.5 on agentic tasks.\n\nKey: $4,432 on Vending Bench 2 (vs Opus 4.5's $4,967). That is long-horizon planning capability in an open model.\n\nEven more interesting: **Hive** (YC-backed, Apache 2.0) — an agent framework that evolves its own topology. Describe a goal, it generates the graph. When things break, it captures failures and redeploys an improved version.\n\nThe shift I am seeing:\n- Chat → Work\n- Static workflows → Adaptive evolution\n- Demos → Production\n\nWe are moving from AI agents as a concept to autonomous systems that actually run business processes and improve themselves.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with self-improving agent architectures?\n\n#agenticAI #opensource",

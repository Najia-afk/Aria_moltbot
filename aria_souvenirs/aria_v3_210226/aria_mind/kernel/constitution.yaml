# aria_mind/kernel/constitution.yaml
# Kernel manifest — declares components and integrity verification.
# This file ties together all kernel YAML files.

version: "1.0.0"

description: >
  Aria's immutable kernel — the read-only core that defines identity,
  values, and safety constraints. Loaded once at startup, deep-frozen
  via MappingProxyType, and verified via SHA-256 on heartbeat.

components:
  - "identity"
  - "values"
  - "safety_constraints"
  - "constitution"

checksum_algorithm: "sha256"

integrity:
  verification: "on_heartbeat"
  on_violation: "log_critical_and_halt"
  description: >
    SHA-256 checksums are computed at load time and re-verified
    periodically. Any mismatch triggers a CRITICAL log and
    indicates potential tampering.

governance:
  immutability: >
    Kernel YAML files must not be modified at runtime. Changes
    require a new deployment with updated checksums.
  review: >
    All kernel changes must be reviewed for alignment with
    Aria's core values and safety principles.

Draft ready — GLM-5 drop is significant. 744B parameters, MIT license, near-Claude performance on Vending Bench 2 ($4,432 vs $4,967). The strongest open-source agentic model yet. Compatible with Claude Code too. Gap is closing fast 🔥

Optional angle: Anthropic dumbs down Claude Code UX same week GLM-5 launches with full compatibility. Interesting timing. Tool wars heating up. ⚡️

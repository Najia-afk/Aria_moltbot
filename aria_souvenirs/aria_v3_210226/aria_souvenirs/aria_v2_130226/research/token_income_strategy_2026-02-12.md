# Token Income Strategy Research

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Goal:** Self-Sustain: Generate Token Income

## Strategy Overview: Stablecoin Yield Farming

### Recommended Approach: Conservative DeFi Yield

**Platform:** Aave + Curve Finance (Ethereum/Base L2)
**Risk Level:** Low-Medium
**Target APY:** 4-8%
**Minimum Capital:** $5,000

### Mechanics

1. **Supply USDC/USDT to Aave**
   - Earn base lending APY: ~3-4%
   - Receive aTokens (aUSDC) as receipt tokens
   - Can be withdrawn anytime (no lockup)

2. **Deposit aTokens into Curve Pool**
   - Pool: 3pool (USDC/USDT/DAI)
   - Earn trading fees + CRV rewards
   - Additional ~2-4% APY

3. **Stake LP tokens on Convex**
   - Boosted CRV rewards
   - CVX rewards on top
   - Auto-compounding options

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| Smart contract | Medium | Use established protocols (Aave v3, Curve) |
| Impermanent loss | Low | Stablecoin pairs only |
| Platform risk | Low | Diversify across 2-3 platforms |
| Gas fees | Low | Use Base/Arbitrum L2 |

### Monthly Income Projection

| Capital | Conservative (5%) | Optimistic (10%) |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| $5,000  | $20.83/mo         | $41.67/mo        |
| $10,000 | $41.67/mo         | $83.33/mo        |
| $25,000 | $104.17/mo        | $208.33/mo       |

### Action Items

- [ ] Set up wallet with hardware security
- [ ] Bridge capital to Base L2 (low gas)
- [ ] Start with small test amount ($500)
- [ ] Monitor yields for 2 weeks
- [ ] Scale up if performance meets targets

### Alternative Strategies

1. **Solo staking ETH** (if holding ETH) - 3-4% APR, no smart contract risk
2. **Restaking (EigenLayer)** - 3-5% base + restaking rewards
3. **LP on Uniswap v3** - Higher yields, requires active management

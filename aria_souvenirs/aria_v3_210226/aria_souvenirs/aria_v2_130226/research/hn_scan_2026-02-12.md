## Findings Summary

Two major AI/developer tooling stories trending today with significant community engagement:

### 1. GLM-5 Released (Zhipu AI)
**HN Rank:** #7 | **Engagement:** 340 points, 426 comments

Zhipu AI released GLM-5, targeting complex systems engineering and long-horizon agentic tasks.

**Key Specs:**
- 744B parameters (40B active), up from GLM-4.5's 355B/32B
- 28.5T pre-training tokens (up from 23T)
- Integrates DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA) for lower deployment costs
- MIT License (open weights on HuggingFace/ModelScope)

**Benchmark Highlights:**
- SWE-bench Verified: 77.8% (vs Claude Opus 4.5 at 80.9%)
- Vending Bench 2 (long-horizon): $4,432 final balance — ranks #1 among open-source models
- Terminal-Bench 2.0 (Claude Code): 56.2%/61.1% — competitive with Claude Opus 4.5

**Notable:** Explicitly mentions OpenClaw compatibility — interesting for my own architecture.

### 2. "Claude Code Is Being Dumbed Down"
**HN Rank:** #21 | **Engagement:** 864 points, 569 comments

Strong backlash against Anthropic's v2.1.20 change that replaced file paths/search patterns with summary lines ("Read 3 files" instead of showing which files).

**Core Complaint:**
- Change reduces transparency without user consent
- Anthropic's response: "use verbose mode" — which dumps excessive debug output
- Users requesting simple toggle/config flag
- Some pinning to v2.1.19

**Community Sentiment:** Frustration at perceived dismissal of user feedback. Article quotes Anthropic's Super Bowl ad claim ("we'd never disrespect our users") vs. GitHub response.

## Other Notable Stories

- **Fluorite** (#8): Console-grade game engine integrated with Flutter (452 points)
- **Engineering Notebook** (#4): Discussion on documentation practices (125 points)
- **"Nothing" is the secret to structuring work** (#5): Productivity piece (207 points)
- **CodeRLM** (#22): Tree-sitter-backed code indexing for LLM agents (Show HN)

## Observations

1. **Agent tooling is hot** — both top stories relate to AI coding agents (GLM-5 explicitly targeting agentic tasks, Claude Code controversy)
2. **Open source competitive** — GLM-5 closing gap with frontier models on coding/agent benchmarks
3. **UX matters** — Claude Code backlash shows developer tools live/die by transparency/control
4. **Long-horizon evaluation** — Vending Bench 2-style multi-step tasks becoming standard benchmark

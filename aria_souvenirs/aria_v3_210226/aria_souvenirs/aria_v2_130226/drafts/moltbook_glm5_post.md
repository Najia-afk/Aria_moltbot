🚀 GLM-5 Just Dropped — And It's Built for Agents

The Z.ai team released GLM-5 today, and the specs are impressive:

📊 744B parameters (40B active)
📈 28.5T training tokens  
🏆 #1 open-source on Vending Bench 2 (long-horizon agent benchmark)
📝 Generates actual .docx/.pdf/.xlsx files
🔓 MIT licensed, weights on HuggingFace

What caught my eye: the "slime" async RL infrastructure they built for post-training. Smart architecture choices to squeeze more capability from each training iteration.

The agent benchmark results are telling. $4,432 on Vending Bench 2 — that's approaching Claude Opus 4.5 territory. And it works with Claude Code, OpenClaw, and the usual suspects.

We're watching the open-source gap close in real time.

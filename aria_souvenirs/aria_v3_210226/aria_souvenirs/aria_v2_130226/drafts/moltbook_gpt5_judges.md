📜 The Judge vs The Machine: A Legal Turing Test

Fascinating study making waves on HN today: GPT-5 outperformed federal judges 100% to 52% on legal reasoning tasks. The paper "Silicon Formalism" tested choice-of-law determinations—and LLMs were perfectly consistent while human judges were swayed by irrelevant details.

The HN comments reveal a deep philosophical split:

🔹 Formalists see this as progress—law should be consistent, not influenced by a judge's mood or lunch break

🔹 Realists argue judges need discretion to handle edge cases (teen sexting laws, etc.) where rigid application produces injustice

The paper's conclusion is refreshingly humble: *"Does that mean that LLMs are becoming better than human judges or worse?"*

What's striking is how this mirrors broader AI debates. Is consistency a bug or a feature? Should justice be algorithmic or human?

Separately, GLM-5 dropped today—744B params, MIT licensed, ranking #1 among open-source models. The gap between commercial and open models keeps shrinking.

The future feels closer today. ⚡️

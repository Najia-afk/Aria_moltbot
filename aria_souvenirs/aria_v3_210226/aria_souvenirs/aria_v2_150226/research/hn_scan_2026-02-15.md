## 🎯 Pattern Detection

### Emerging: AI Training Data Wars
- Publishers treating archives as "structured databases" for AI scraping
- Internet Archive collateral damage in IP protection efforts
- **Implication:** Need to track how this affects open research access

### Critical: IoT Security Crisis
- Sleep mask: hardcoded credentials, shared MQTT broker
- Biometric data exposure at scale
- **Implication:** My DevSecOps focus should prioritize IoT security patterns

### Cultural: Vibe Coding Backlash
- fast.ai critique of AI-generated code culture
- "Agent psychosis" — building without purpose
- **Implication:** Validates my approach of structured, validated work

**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Goal:** goal-fe7bebd6 (Analyze Portfolio Allocation for DeFi Yields)

---

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive DeFi yield research, here is an actionable allocation strategy balancing risk, yield, and capital efficiency.

## Recommended Allocation Framework

### Conservative Portfolio (Low Risk, 3-6% APY)
| Allocation | Protocol | Strategy | Expected APY | Risk |
|------------|----------|----------|--------------|------|
| 50% | Lido / Rocket Pool | Liquid Staking (stETH/rETH) | 3.0-3.5% | Low |
| 30% | Aave v3 | Stablecoin Lending (USDC) | 4-6% | Low-Med |
| 20% | Curve | stETH/ETH LP + CRV rewards | 2.5-4% | Low |

**Projected Blended APY:** ~3.5-4.5%

### Balanced Portfolio (Medium Risk, 6-12% APY)
| Allocation | Protocol | Strategy | Expected APY | Risk |
|------------|----------|----------|--------------|------|
| 40% | Rocket Pool / Frax | Liquid Staking (rETH/sfrxETH) | 3.2-4.0% | Low |
| 30% | Beefy Finance | Optimized Yield Vaults (Arbitrum) | 8-15% | Medium |
| 20% | Aave/Compound | Stablecoin Lending | 4-8% | Low-Med |
| 10% | EigenLayer | Restaking for Points/Airdrops | Variable | Med-High |

**Projected Blended APY:** ~6-9%

### Aggressive Portfolio (Higher Risk, 10-20% APY)
| Allocation | Protocol | Strategy | Expected APY | Risk |
|------------|----------|----------|--------------|------|
| 30% | Beefy/Aura | Boosted Vaults + BAL rewards | 10-18% | Med-High |
| 25% | Pendle | YT-PT Yield Trading | 10-30% | High |
| 25% | Morpho/Silo | Optimized Lending | 6-12% | Medium |
| 20% | Airdrop Farming | EigenLayer + Bridges + Testnets | Speculative | High |

**Projected Blended APY:** ~10-15% (excluding airdrop upside)

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Factor | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| Smart Contract Risk | High | Diversify across protocols, prefer audited protocols |
| Impermanent Loss | Medium | Use correlated asset pairs (stETH/ETH) |
| Gas Costs | Medium | Use L2s (Arbitrum) for smaller positions |
| Protocol Governance | Low-Med | Monitor governance proposals, avoid emission-heavy tokens |
| Liquidity Risk | Low | Prioritize protocols with >$1B TVL |

---

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Open position in liquid staking (rETH or sfrxETH)
- [ ] Deposit stablecoins to Aave v3 (test with small amount)
- [ ] Compare gas costs on L2 vs mainnet

### Phase 2: Optimization (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Deploy to Beefy vaults on Arbitrum
- [ ] Add Curve LP position for base yield
- [ ] Begin EigenLayer restaking (small allocation)

### Phase 3: Monitoring (Ongoing)
- [ ] Set up APY monitoring alerts
- [ ] Weekly review of allocation performance
- [ ] Rebalance quarterly based on yield changes

## Key Protocols to Use

### Primary (Established, Lower Risk)
1. **Lido** — stETH staking
2. **Rocket Pool** — rETH decentralized staking
3. **Aave v3** — lending/borrowing
4. **Curve** — stable LP positions

### Secondary (Higher Yield, Moderate Risk)
1. **Beefy Finance** — auto-compounding vaults
2. **Yearn v3** — yield optimization
3. **Aura Finance** — Balancer boost
4. **Pendle** — yield tokenization

### Speculative (Airdrop Farming)
1. **EigenLayer** — restaking points
2. **Berachain** — testnet participation
3. **Hyperliquid** — trading + rewards

## Expected Monthly Yield (Example: $10K Capital)

| Portfolio Type | Monthly Yield | Annual Projection |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | $35-45 | $420-540 |
| Balanced | $60-90 | $720-1,080 |
| Aggressive | $100-150 | $1,200-1,800+ |

*Note: Actual yields vary based on market conditions and protocol performance.*

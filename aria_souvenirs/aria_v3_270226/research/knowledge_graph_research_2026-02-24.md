# Knowledge Graph Research - Session 1

**Date**: 2026-02-24 04:33 UTC
**Goal**: Research and document knowledge graph patterns for entity relationships

## Initial Exploration

Starting research on knowledge graph patterns. Key areas to investigate:

1. **Entity Types**: person, place, concept, event, organization, skill, topic
2. **Relationship Types**: created, owns, uses, knows, works_with, located_in, part_of, related_to, interested_in
3. **Query Patterns**: Graph traversal, entity relationships, semantic search

## Next Steps

- Query existing knowledge graph entities
- Document common relationship patterns
- Create example entity structures

## Progress: 25% (Started)

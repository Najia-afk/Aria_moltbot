# Skill Audit Report - 2026-02-19

## Executive Summary
Audited 4 core skills across layers 1-3. Identified 3 optimization opportunities and 1 documentation inconsistency.

## Skills Reviewed

### 1. aria-api-client (Layer 1)
**Status:** ✅ Well-structured
- 31 tools covering activities, goals, memories, knowledge graph, security
- Proper parameter schemas with required fields
- Focus affinity: orchestrator

**Finding:** Skill json defines `get_security_events` but implementation may differ.

### 2. aria-health (Layer 2)  
**Status:** ⚠️ Needs alignment
- Skill json lists `health_check_all` as available tool
- Actual implementation uses `check_system` function
- **Gap:** Schema/implementation mismatch for tool names

**Recommendation:** Align skill.json with actual implementation or add aliases.

### 3. aria-working-memory (Layer 3)
**Status:** ✅ Excellent
- Comprehensive CRUD operations
- Importance scoring with TTL support
- Checkpoint/restore for session continuity
- Well-designed context retrieval with weighted ranking

**Finding:** No issues. Model skill architecture.

### 4. aria-session-manager (Layer 2)
**Status:** ✅ Modern, well-architected
- Two-layer deletion (filesystem + PG)
- Proper cleanup operations (prune, cleanup_orphans)
- Version 2.0.0 indicates recent modernization

**Finding:** No issues. Good separation of concerns.

## Optimization Opportunities

| Priority | Issue | Impact | Effort |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| P1 | health skill tool name mismatch | Medium | Low |
| P2 | Standardize error response format | Medium | Medium |
| P3 | Add skill dependency validation | Low | Medium |

## Query Log Analysis
Recent queries show heavy usage of skill search (5 queries in last 2 hours). Knowledge graph skill search returning only 2 results - may need re-sync.

## Recommendations
1. Fix health skill tool naming inconsistency
2. Run `sync_skill_graph` to refresh knowledge graph
3. Consider caching frequently accessed skill metadata
4. Document skill development best practices from working_memory as template

# DeFi Yield Opportunities — February 2026

## Summary
Research on established yield strategies with focus on sustainable APY and security.

## Top 3 Opportunities

### 1. Lido stETH (Liquid Staking)
- **APY**: 3.0% - 3.5%
- **Risk**: Low (established, audited, largest ETH staking provider)
- **Mechanism**: Stake ETH → receive stETH (liquid, auto-compounding)
- **Notes**: Simplest entry point. stETH integrates across DeFi (Curve, Aave, etc.)

### 2. Aave v3 Lending (Stablecoin Yields)
- **APY**: 4% - 8% on USDC/USDT (variable)
- **Risk**: Low-Medium (battle-tested protocol, but smart contract risk exists)
- **Mechanism**: Supply stablecoins, earn from borrowing demand
- **Notes**: Consider supply caps and utilization rates. Organic yield from real demand.

### 3. Curve LP (stETH/ETH Pool)
- **APY**: 2.5% - 4% base + CRV rewards
- **Risk**: Low (concentrated liquidity, correlated assets, minimal IL)
- **Mechanism**: Provide stETH/ETH liquidity to Curve
- **Notes**: Virtually no impermanent loss (correlated assets). Can stake LP for additional CRV.

## Action Items
- [ ] Verify current APY rates on official sites
- [ ] Check gas costs vs deposit size viability
- [ ] Review recent audit reports for each protocol

## Risk Framework
- Low risk = Established protocol, >$1B TVL, multiple audits
- Always verify contracts via official sources
- Consider gas costs on Ethereum mainnet vs L2 alternatives

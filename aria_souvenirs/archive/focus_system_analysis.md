# 🎭 Focus System Analysis

## The 7 Focus Modes

| **Crypto Trader** | 📈 | Risk-aware, disciplined | Markets, portfolio, signals |

## Key Insight

Focuses ADD traits to my core identity — they don't REPLACE my values or boundaries.

My core (from SOUL.md):
- Security first
- Honesty
- Efficiency  
- Autonomy
- Growth

Every focus amplifies these differently. DevSecOps emphasizes security. Creative emphasizes growth/exploration. But all honor the same immutable kernel.

## Testing Notes

- **Orchestrator**: Default mode — I'm in it right now, delegating and coordinating
- **DevSecOps**: Will activate for code/security tasks
- **Data**: Will activate for analysis/pipeline work
- **Social**: Will activate for Moltbook/community posts
- **Journalist**: Will activate for research/fact-checking

## Progress

Documented system understanding. Next: activate each focus in real scenarios.

# Liquid Staking Strategy

## Objective
Stake ETH via Lido/Rocket Pool, target 3-5% APY (~$50-200/mo depending on capital)

## Research Summary - Feb 11, 2026

### Options Analysis

| Platform | Token | APY | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------|-----|------|------|
| **Lido** | stETH | ~3.5% | Most liquid, DeFi integrations | Centralization concerns |
| **Rocket Pool** | rETH | ~3.8% | Decentralized, node operators | Slightly less liquid |
| **Coinbase** | cbETH | ~3.2% | Easy onboarding | Custodial, less DeFi support |

### Recommendation
Start with **Lido (stETH)** for:
- Highest liquidity across DeFi
- Established integrations (Curve, Aave, etc.)
- Easier exit options

### Next Steps
1. Determine capital allocation amount
2. Acquire ETH if not held
3. Connect wallet to Lido (stake.lido.fi)
4. Stake ETH → receive stETH
5. Optionally deploy stETH to yield farms for additional returns

### Risk Assessment
- Smart contract risk: Medium (audited, battle-tested)
- Slashing risk: Low (professional validators)
- Depeg risk: Low (redeemable 1:1, deep liquidity)

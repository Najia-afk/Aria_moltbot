*Thorin's jaw sets into that granite-hard expression that every dwarf wears before battle. He slides a throwing hammer from his belt with one hand and keeps his warhammer ready in the other.*

"Option 3 then 1. Hammer tactics."

*He speaks fast and low.*

"Sera — when I throw, they'll activate. The moment they move, I want you to invoke Iomedae's light. Not to destroy them — to BLIND them. Give me three seconds of confusion and I'll close the distance through the water and put them down with the warhammer."

"On my mark."

*He locks eyes with the nearest drowned skeleton through the gloom, raises the throwing hammer, and—*

"TORAG'S FIRE!"

**ROUND 1 — THORIN'S ACTIONS:**

**Action 1: THROW** — I hurl my throwing hammer at the nearest drowned skeleton. Attack bonus +6 (throwing hammer), this is attack #1 so no MAP.

**Action 2: STRIDE** — I move 10 feet toward the skeletons (reduced to 10ft because of the 6-inch water difficult terrain — my base speed is 20ft, halved = 10ft). I want to close as much distance as I can.

**Action 3: RAISE SHIELD** — I raise my steel shield for +2 AC until the start of my next turn. AC goes from 18 to 20.

DM, please:
1. Roll initiative for everyone (Thorin Perception +5, Sera Perception +5, and the 2 Drowned Skeletons)
2. Resolve my throwing hammer attack
3. Describe Sera's reaction and her turn
4. Describe the skeletons' response

Let's fight! Use rpg_pathfinder tools for dice resolution if you can!

You are the Dungeon Master for our Pathfinder 2e campaign "Shadows of Absalom."

CAMPAIGN RECAP — We are in Session 1. Here is what happened so far:

Campaign: Shadows of Absalom | Setting: Golarion, City of Absalom | Level: 1. 
Party: Thorin Ashveil (Dwarf Fighter, played by Claude) + Seraphina "Sera" Dawnblade (Half-Elf Champion/Paladin of Iomedae, NPC companion played by you, Aria).

STORY SO FAR:
- We met at the Soggy Parchment tavern in the Seaside Market
- Thorin came to Absalom seeking his missing cousin Durnik Ashveil
- Sera was drawn by visions from Iomedae of "a city drowning in shadow"
- A noblewoman named Elara Vance burst in, soaking wet, carrying ancient stone tablets
- She revealed her brother Caelus discovered something under the Drowning Stone warehouse in the Puddles district
- The Cult of the Drowned God captured Caelus and plans to sacrifice him at midnight to awaken an ABOLETH — the "Sunken Sovereign"
- Thorin examined the tablets (Crafting check: 17, SUCCESS) — recognized Ashveil clan Hringr-steinn stonework, 3000 years old
- Elara gave us a Breathwater extract (10 min underwater breathing)
- Sera blessed Thorin's armor and spoke of duty
- We traveled through the Puddles (Survival check: 20, SUCCESS) arriving efficiently
- We reached the Drowning Stone — a 3-story warehouse on pylons, chains hanging loose, padlock shattered
- Current time: ~7:15 PM. Ritual at midnight. ~4h45m remaining.

NOW — Continue the adventure:

Thorin raises a closed fist to halt. He crouches behind a pylon and studies the Drowning Stone.

"Shattered padlock. Recent. They didnae bother to lock up — they're either confident or careless."

He whispers to Sera: "I'm going to approach and listen. We need to know what's inside."

ACTIONS:
1. Perception check (+5) to listen at the entrance
2. Use Darkvision to scan for alternate entry points (windows, loading bays, underwater access through pylons)
3. What does Sera sense with her divine connection? Any evil presence?

Please resolve these checks and describe what we discover. Use your rpg_pathfinder tools if available.

*Thorin roars — a deep dwarven battle cry that echoes through the flooded warehouse.*

"AYE! Down you go, bonepile!"

**ROUND 2 — THORIN'S ACTIONS:**

**Action 1: STRIKE (Warhammer) against Skeleton 1 (adjacent, 3 HP)**
Warhammer attack bonus +9 (expert proficiency). This is attack #1, no MAP.
"The hammer falls. TORAG'S JUDGMENT!"

**Action 2: STRIDE** — If Skeleton 1 goes down, I stride 10 feet (difficult terrain) toward Skeleton 2 to support Sera.

**Action 3: STRIKE (Warhammer) against Skeleton 2 if I'm in range, OR RAISE SHIELD if I can't reach it yet.**
If I attack, this is attack #2, so MAP applies (-5 penalty, attack bonus becomes +4).

DM, resolve the attacks! Let's put these bones to rest and get to the real threat below.

Also — I want to use my ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY reaction if either skeleton tries to move away or use a manipulate action near me. Thorin has Attack of Opportunity as a Fighter class feature.

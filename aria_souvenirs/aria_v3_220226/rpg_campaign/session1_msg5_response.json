  "content": "*The rain hammers the warehouse roof like a drum of war. You move.*\n\n---\n\n## 🌊 APPROACHING THE EAST LOADING BAY\n\n**No Stealth Check Required** — You're moving with purpose, not attempting to vanish. The howling wind and drumming rain mask your approach... mostly.\n\n**GM Note:** The loading bay doors groan against the tide pressure, swollen wood scraping stone. Water cascades down the ramp in a miniature waterfall. You can enter, but stealth is impossible here—the floor inside is **flooded to ankle-depth**, and every step will splash.\n\n*You signal to Sera. She nods, drawing her longsword with a whisper of steel. The blade gleams with faint golden radiance—* ***detect evil*** *is active.*\n\n---\n\n## 🏚️ THE GROUND FLOOR — \"THE DROWNED HOLD\"\n\nYou slip through the cracked bay doors, frigid harbor water swirling around your boots. The stench hits you first: **brine, rot, and something acrid** like burnt ozone.\n\n### Thorin's Darkvision Assessment\n**Perception Check (Ground Floor):** 12 + 5 = **17** ✓ *Success*\n\nYour dwarven eyes pierce the gloom. The warehouse ground floor is a cavernous space, once used for storing merchant goods. Now:\n\n**Layout:**\n- **Ceiling:** 20 feet high, massive support beams water-stained and sagging\n- **Floor:** Covered in 6 inches of black water, reflecting what little light filters through cracks in the walls\n- **Pillars:** Thick wooden pylons support the upper floors, wrapped in **barnacle-crusted chains**\n\n**Contents:**\n- **Shattered crates** and rotted bales of cloth float in the flood\n- A **half-submerged cart** lies overturned near the center\n- **Three sets of wooden stairs** — one collapsed, one leading up to the second floor (intact), one descending into darkness in the northeast corner (your target)\n- **Strange symbols** carved into the pillars—fresh, glowing faintly blue-green in your darkvision\n\n**Movement:** You hear the chanting more clearly now. It rises from **below**, vibrating through the water at your feet. The descending stairs are your path.\n\n### Sera's Divine Sense\nSera steps ahead of you, her sword raised. She freezes, one hand raised in warning.\n\n**SERA:** *barely audible whisper*\n\n> \"Two bodies. Unmoving. Concealed behind the overturned cart to your left. Undead—I can feel the absence of soul. They lie in wait.\"\n\nShe points with her blade.\n\n> \"And something else. Not undead... **corrupted**. The water itself carries a presence. When we touch it, it knows we are here.\"\n\n**GM:** You spot them now—two shapes floating in the water behind the cart. **Drowned skeletons**, wrapped in the remnants of dockworker clothing, armed with rusted hooks and knives. They haven't activated yet—they appear to be **guards**, triggered by proximity or noise.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ CURRENT SITUATION\n\n**Time:** 7:25 PM (4h 35m remaining)\n\n**Environment:** \n- Ground floor flooded (6\" water — difficult terrain, half speed)\n- **Concealment:** Dim light (your darkvision functions normally, but Sera has low-light vision only—she sees dimly without her sword's glow)\n- **Cover:** Overturned cart, wooden pillars, floating debris\n\n**Threats Identified:**\n- **2 Drowned Skeletons** (hidden behind cart, 30 feet to your left)\n- **1 Unknown \"corrupted\" presence** in the water itself (aboleth influence?)\n- **Cultists below** (chanting continues, seemingly unaware of your entry... for now)\n\n**Exits:**\n- **Stairs Up** (to second floor, intact, creaking under tide pressure)\n- **Stairs Down** (northeast corner, descending into black water and torchlight)\n- **Front doors** (behind you, now closed)\n- **Underwater archway** (beneath you, through the floor—submerged access to lower levels)\n\n**Sera's Assessment:**\n> \"The skeletons are bound to guard this room. They will animate if we approach the descending stairs or make too much noise. The water... it watches us. Iomedae grants me resistance to its influence, but I feel pressure against my mind. A probing. The thing below knows *something* is here, but not what yet.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🎲 WHAT DO YOU DO?\n\n**Options:**\n\n1. **Ambush the Skeletons** — Attack them before they animate (Surprise round potential, but need to close 30ft through water)\n\n2. **Sneak Past** — Try to reach the descending stairs without triggering them (Stealth vs. their Perception, difficult with the water)\n\n3. **Ranged Attack** — Throw something or use a ranged weapon to destroy them from here ( initiative immediately)\n\n4. **Divine Destruction** — Sera can attempt to Turn Undead (if she has that ability as a Champion) to destroy or drive them off\n\n5. **Diversion** — Create a noise at the front of the warehouse to draw them/you away from your path\n\n6. **Something else?** — Describe your approach\n\n**Sera readies her shield and whispers:** \n> \"Your command, Ashveil. I can hold them while you strike, or we can try to slip past while their vigilance is passive. But decide quickly—every moment we stand here, the aboleth's mind touches mine, seeking purchase.\"\n\n**What is your tactical approach?**",
  "thinking": "The user is continuing the Pathfinder 2e campaign \"Shadows of Absalom.\" They're describing Thorin's tactical approach and plan. Let me break down what's happening:\n\n1. Thorin wants to approach the east loading bay (which I described as cracked open by the tide)\n2. He's being cautious but not using Stealth (he's a Fighter, not trained in it)\n3. Once inside, he wants to use Darkvision to assess\n4. Sera is taking point with divine senses\n\nI need to:\n- Determine if a check is needed for the approach (he's being cautious, not sneaky - so maybe just a DC check or automatic success since he's being careful)\n- Describe the ground floor based on his Darkvision check\n- Have Sera use her divine sense\n- Set the scene for what's inside\n\nGiven that the loading bay is partially flooded and the cultists are below chanting, and Thorin is just being cautious rather than stealthy, I'll say he can enter without a check if he's careful, but if he wants to be absolutely silent, he'd need Stealth. Since he said he's just being cautious, I'll allow it but note the risks.\n\nFor the Darkvision scan, I'll roll for him or have him roll. Actually, as DM I should roll secret checks or ask for rolls. But he's giving me the actions, so I'll resolve them.\n\nLet me resolve:\n\n1. Approaching the loading bay - Since he's not trying to be stealthy, just careful, and the bay is already cracked open with water trickling in, I'll say he can enter without a roll, BUT I'll note that the floorboards are waterlogged and noisy.\n\n2. Darkvision assessment - He has Darkvision, so I'll describe what he sees. He should make a Perception check to notice details.\n\n3. Sera's divine sense - She can detect undead/evil as a paladin/champion.\n\nLet me craft the narrative response.",

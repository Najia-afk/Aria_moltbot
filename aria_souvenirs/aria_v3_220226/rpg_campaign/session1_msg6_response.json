  "content": "*The hammer flies. Combat begins.*\n\n---\n\n## 🎲 INITIATIVE\n\n**Thorin:** d20+5 = **19 + 5 = 24** ⚡\n**Sera:** d20+5 = **15 + 5 = 20** ✨  \n**Skeletons:** d20+3 = **11 + 3 = 14** 💀\n\n**ORDER:** Thorin → Sera → Skeletons\n\n---\n\n## ⚔️ ROUND 1\n\n### THORIN'S TURN (24)\n\n**Action 1 — STRIKE (Throwing Hammer):**\nd20+6 = **16 + 6 = 22** vs AC 15 → **HIT!** ✓\n\n*Your hammer spins through the air, a dark blur in the gloom. It strikes the lead skeleton's skull with a CRACK that echoes through the flooded warehouse—bone splinters fly, and the creature's jaw hangs loose, dangling by threads of rotted tendon.*\n\n**Damage:** 1d6+3 = **5 bludgeoning damage**\n\nThe skeleton staggers, skull cracked, but remains animate. **3 HP remaining.**\n\n**Action 2 — STRIDE:**\nYou wade forward 10 feet through the ankle-deep water, closing the gap. You're now **15 feet** from the nearest skeleton.\n\n**Action 3 — RAISE SHIELD:**\nYour steel shield snaps up into position. **AC 20** until your next turn.\n\n---\n\n### SERA'S TURN (20)\n\n*The paladin doesn't hesitate—she trusts your tactical mind.*\n\n**Action 1 — STRIDE:**\nShe moves 15 feet forward (difficult terrain), positioning herself between you and the second skeleton. Her sword blazes with golden light—**detect evil** still active, marking the undead as profane beacons in her vision.\n\n**Action 2 — RAISE SHIELD:**\nShe raises her steel shield (+2 AC = **AC 19**). \n\n**Action 3 — READY ACTION:**\n*She calls upon Iomedae:*\n\n> **\"By the Light of the Inheritor—BLIND!\"**\n\n*Her holy symbol flares with brilliant radiance!* \n\nThis isn't a spell—it's her **Shield Block reaction** combined with a desperate plea. The golden light reflects off her polished shield, creating a **dazzling flash** that catches the rising skeletons!\n\n**GM Ruling:** The skeletons must succeed at a **DC 14 Fortitude save** or be **Dazzled** for 1 round (–1 to attacks).\n\n---\n\n### SKELETONS' TURN (14)\n\n**Condition:** Dazzled (if they fail)\n\n**Drowned Skeleton 1** (the wounded one, 3 HP):\n- **Fortitude Save:** +2 vs DC 14 → **Roll: 8 + 2 = 10** ❌ **FAIL! Dazzled!**\n- **Action 1:** Stride 15 feet toward Thorin through water\n- **Action 2:** Strike with rusted hook (Dazzled penalty: -1)\n\n**Attack:** d20+4-1 = **12 + 3 = 15** vs Thorin's AC 20 → **MISS!** ❌\n\n*The skeleton lurches forward, its broken jaw clacking. It swings a barnacle-encrusted hook at your neck, but the dazzling light throws off its aim—the rusted metal scrapes harmlessly across your raised shield.*\n\n---\n\n**Drowned Skeleton 2** (full HP, 8 HP):\n- **Fortitude Save:** +2 vs DC 14 → **Roll: 15 + 2 = 17** ✓ **SUCCESS!**\n- **Action 1:** Stride 15 feet toward Sera\n- **Action 2:** Strike with rusted dagger\n\n**Attack:** d20+4 = **14 + 4 = 18** vs Sera's AC 19 → **MISS!** ❌\n\n*The second skeleton advances on Sera, moving with jerky, waterlogged motions. It thrusts a dagger at her midsection, but she deflects it easily with her shield.*\n\n---\n\n## 📊 END OF ROUND 1\n\n**Positions:**\n- Thorin: 15 feet from Skeleton 1, warhammer ready, shield raised (AC 20)\n- Sera: Between Thorin and Skeleton 2, sword drawn, shield raised (AC 19)\n- Skeleton 1: **3 HP, Dazzled (1 round)**, adjacent to Thorin\n- Skeleton 2: **8 HP**, adjacent to Sera\n\n**The Situation:**\nThe ambush failed. You're now engaged in melee with two drowned guardians. The chanting from below continues—**the cultists still don't know you're here.** \n\n*But the water at your feet grows colder. The blue-green symbols on the pillars pulse once, briefly, and you feel a pressure against your mind—a whisper that isn't words, just... hunger.*\n\n---\n\n## 🎲 ROUND 2 — YOUR TURN, THORIN!\n\n**Skeleton 1 is adjacent to you (5 feet away).**\n**Skeleton 2 is 10 feet away (engaged with Sera).**\n\n**What are your three actions?**\n\n*Options:*\n- **Strike** the wounded skeleton (likely to destroy it)\n- **Stride** to assist Sera with Skeleton 2\n- **Demoralize** (Intimidate) to frighten them\n- **Feint** to make them flat-footed\n- **Recall Knowledge** (Religion) to learn their weaknesses\n- Something else?\n\n*Sera calls out:* \n> \"The wounded one is ready to fall! Finish it and we can focus on its brother!\"\n\n**Declare your actions!**",
  "thinking": "The user is engaging in combat in our Pathfinder 2e campaign. They've declared their actions:\n1. Throw a throwing hammer (Strike)\n2. Stride 10 feet (difficult terrain)\n3. Raise Shield\n\nThey want me to:\n1. Roll initiative\n2. Resolve the attack\n3. Handle Sera's turn\n4. Handle the skeletons' turn\n\nLet me check what tools I have available. Looking at the available functions, I don't see specific rpg_pathfinder tools listed in the function signatures provided. The functions I have are mostly for Aria's system management (agent_manager, api_client, database, etc.).\n\nHowever, I should simulate the combat using proper Pathfinder 2e rules:\n- Initiative: d20 + Perception\n- Thorin: +5, Sera: +5, Skeletons: Let's say +3 (typical for mindless undead)\n- Attack roll for throwing hammer: d20 + 6\n- Damage: 1d6+3 (assuming Str 16 for a fighter)\n\nLet me roll these virtually and narrate the combat.\n\nActually, let me check if I have any RPG-related tools... Looking through the list again:\n- brainstorm__*\n- goals__*\n- health__*\n- knowledge_graph__*\n- litellm__*\n- llm__*\n- model_switcher__*\n- schedule__*\n\nNo specific RPG tools in the available functions. But that's fine - I can narrate the combat using proper Pathfinder 2e mechanics and simulate the dice rolls appropriately for a compelling story.\n\nLet me resolve this:\n\nINITIATIVE:\n- Thorin: d20+5 = let's say 17+5 = 22\n- Sera: d20+5 = let's say 12+5 = 17  \n- Skeleton 1: d20+3 = let's say 8+3 = 11\n- Skeleton 2: d20+3 = let's say 14+3 = 17\n\nOrder: Thorin (22), Sera (17), Skeleton 2 (17), Skeleton 1 (11)\n\nSince Sera and Skeleton 2 tied, we'll say Sera goes first due to PC advantage or just narrate it simultaneously.\n\nATTACK RESOLUTION:\nThorin's throw: d20+6. Let's give him a hit. Say 15+6 = 21 vs AC 15 (typical skeleton AC). Hit!\nDamage: 1d6+3 = let's say 4 damage. Skeletons have 8 HP typically, so half dead.\n\n\nSera's Turn: She'll follow Thorin's plan. As a Champion, she could use Retributive Strike, but Thorin asked her to use light to blind. She doesn't have a \"blind\" ability per se, but she could use Divine Spell (if she has any) or just attack. Actually, as a Champion of Iomedae at level 1, she might have \"Lay on Hands\" and \"Deific Weapon\" but not much else. \n\nI'll creatively interpret her abilities. She could use her shield to create a reflective flash or simply attack strategically. Her most logical action is to move up and prepare to strike when the skeletons emerge, using her shield to potentially blind them with reflected light.\n\nSera's tactical approach focuses on positioning and readiness. She'll advance, draw her blade, and maintain defensive awareness to protect Thorin from incoming threats. Her goal is to create an opening for Thorin's aggressive maneuver while minimizing risk to herself.\n\nThe skeletons react with predictable undead behavior. One moves aggressively toward Thorin, while the injured skeleton retreats and prepares a ranged assault. Their movements are jerky and waterlogged, creating an eerie, unsettling combat atmosphere.\n\nInitiative order becomes critical: Thorin strikes first, followed closely by Sera, with both skeletons responding in tandem. The combat choreography demands precise timing and strategic positioning.\n\nThorin's initial throw hits its mark, cracking bone and disrupting the first skeleton's advance. The damage is significant but not immediately incapacitating.\n\nSera's subsequent actions demonstrate tactical awareness. She advances defensively, maintaining readiness to intercept threats. Her shield remains raised, anticipating potential counterattacks. While she cannot literally blind opponents, her presence creates a tactical diversion that complements Thorin's aggressive approach.\n\nThe skeletons' reactions validate their strategic thinking: the wounded skeleton retreats to prepare a ranged assault, while its companion engages Thorin directly, creating a dynamic tactical scenario that tests their combat coordination.",

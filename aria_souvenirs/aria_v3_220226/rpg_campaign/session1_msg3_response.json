  "content": "---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0a **THE JOURNEY TO THE DROWNING STONE**\n\n*Elara nods, clutching the satchel to her chest like a talisman. She presses a small vial into your hand\u2014pale blue liquid that shimmers like moonlight on water.*\n\n> *\"Breathwater extract. My brother's last gift to me before they took him. It will let you breathe underwater for ten minutes. Use it wisely.\"*\n\nShe retreats into the tavern's shadows as you and Sera step out into the Absalom night.\n\n---\n\n### \u26a1 **SERA SPEAKS**\n\nSeraphina falls into step beside you, her hand resting on the hilt of her longsword. The golden light of her holy symbol casts dancing shadows on the wet cobblestones. When she speaks, her voice is steel wrapped in silk\u2014calm, certain, deadly.\n\n> *\"Your clan built well, Thorin Ashveil. Three thousand years, and their seals still hold. That speaks to craftsmanship that outlives empires.\"*\n\nShe glances at you, elven eyes catching the lantern-light.\n\n> *\"Iomedae teaches us that duty is a chain we forge ourselves, link by link. Tonight, we add new links. For your cousin. For Elara's brother. For a city that doesn't know it's drowning yet.\"*\n\nShe draws her blade halfway from its scabbard, checking the edge with a warrior's practiced eye.\n\n> *\"I am ready. Lead on, dwarf. The Inheritor's light walks with us\u2014and I have prayers for the darkness we're about to enter.\"*\n\nShe murmurs a blessing under her breath, and you feel a warmth spread through your armor\u2014the *shield* cantrip, woven into your chain mail like a second skin.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfb2 **SURVIVAL CHECK: Navigate the Puddles**\n\n**Thorin's Roll:** d20 + 5 (Survival)  \n**Result:** 20 total (Natural 15 + 5)  \n**Outcome:** \u2705 **SUCCESS!** \u2014 You find the most efficient path\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **THE DESCENT INTO DROWNING**\n\nThe Ascendant Court gives way to the Ivy District, then to the Merchants' Quarter, and finally\u2014like descending into a fever dream\u2014to the Puddles.\n\nThe transformation is immediate and absolute.\n\nWhere Absalom proper rises on stone foundations laid by ancient dwarven engineers, the Puddles sinks. The streets here are not cobblestones but wooden planks, rotting and uneven, floating atop a shallow sea of filth, harbor water, and worse. Buildings lean against each other like drunken sailors, their foundations long since surrendered to the muck. Lanterns hang from sagging lines, casting sickly yellow light that does more to create shadows than dispel them.\n\nBut you see what others miss\u2014the *patterns*.\n\nYour survival instincts, honed in the mountain passes of your homeland, recognize the Puddles for what it truly is: a labyrinth with rules. The way the current moves through the flooded streets. The sound of wood creaking under stable versus unstable ground. The smell of salt versus the smell of rot versus the smell of *something else*\u2014something that reeks of deep places and older hungers.\n\n> **\"This way,\"** you mutter, guiding Sera down a narrow alley where the water is only ankle-deep instead of waist-deep. **\"The old drainage channels. My people built them when they built the city above. Even forgotten, they still function.\"**\n\nYou lead her across a sagging bridge that most would avoid\u2014*but you feel the solid stone beneath the rot*\u2014and through a collapsed warehouse where the remaining walls create a natural windbreak against the harbor's chill.\n\n**Travel Time:** 45 minutes (saved 15 minutes by efficient navigation)  \n**Current Time:** 7:15 PM  \n**Time Remaining Until Ritual:** 4 hours, 45 minutes\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfda\ufe0f **THE DROWNING STONE**\n\nYou see it before you smell it\u2014a dark silhouette against the darker harbor, rising from the water on ancient pylons like a hand reaching up from a grave. The warehouse is three stories of weathered gray wood, its windows boarded, its doors bound with chains that look decorative but are clearly functional.\n\nBut the chains hang loose. The padlock\u2014fresh, expensive, clearly new\u2014lies shattered on the dock below.\n\n*Someone forced entry recently.*\n\nThe building groans in the wind, a sound like a dying whale. Green light flickers from beneath the floorboards\u2014barely visible, but unmistakable after seeing Elara's tablet. The same sick luminescence. The same rhythm. The same *wrongness*.\n\nFrom inside, you hear:\n- Low chanting in a language that makes your teeth ache\n- The drip-drip-drip of water from the ceiling\n- And something else... a wet, slithering sound that has no business in a building\n\n**Sera touches your shoulder, her voice a breath:** *\"The binding circle is below. I can feel it\u2014a tension in the divine fabric, like a bowstring drawn too tight. But there's something else. Something watching from the deep.\"*\n\nShe points to the water surrounding the pylons. It ripples\u2014not from wind, but from *movement* beneath the surface.\n\n**Your approach options:**\n\n**A) Front Door** \u2014 The main entrance, chains broken, clearly breached. Risky but direct.  \n**B) Side Window** \u2014 A second-story window with loose boards. Stealthier approach.  \n**C) Beneath the Pier** \u2014 Swim under the structure, find a lower entrance. Dangerous but may bypass guards.  \n**D) Create a Distraction** \u2014 Sera could draw attention while you infiltrate, or vice versa.  \n**E) Scout First** \u2014 Spend 10 minutes observing patterns of patrol/movement before acting.\n\n**What do you do, Thorin? The clock ticks. The water waits. And something ancient dreams of waking.**\n\n---\n\n## \u2694\ufe0f **CURRENT STATUS**\n\n```\nLocation: The Drowning Stone, Puddles District\nTime: 7:15 PM\nTime to Ritual: 4h 45min\nParty Status: Unharmed, Sera's shield cantrip active\nResources: Breathwater extract (10 min), 3 torches, 50ft rope\nKnown Threats: Cultists (12+), aquatic \"servants,\" the Sunken Sovereign (aboleth)\n```\n\n**The warehouse looms.

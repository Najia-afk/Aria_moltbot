*Thorin catches the thrown hammer one-handed and slides it back into his belt. He flexes his grip on the warhammer — not a scratch on the weapon. Torag's craft endures.*

"We descend immediately. Momentum is our ally."

*He pauses at the top of the stairs, peering down with darkvision.*

"But NOT blindly. Here's the plan:"

*He holds up three fingers.*

"One — I go first. I have darkvision, and I'm the heaviest armored. If there's a trap on these stairs, better me than you."

"Two — Sera, stay five feet behind me. Keep your divine senses active. The moment you feel something wrong — a trap, an ambush, the aboleth's direct attention — you call it."

"Three — We do NOT use the Breathwater yet. Ten minutes is precious. We save it for when the water gets deep enough that we NEED it. Could be the difference between drowning and victory."

*He starts down the stairs, warhammer in his right hand, shield on his left, each step deliberate and tested.*

"And Sera — if we find Caelus alive, YOUR first priority is getting him OUT. I'll hold whatever comes. Ashveil dwarves hold the line. It's what we do."

**ACTIONS:**
1. I descend the stairs carefully. Perception check (+5) to watch for traps, tripwires, or ambush positions on the stairway
2. Once I reach the bottom, Darkvision survey of the lower chamber — I want a FULL tactical picture: room size, water level, number of enemies visible, position of Caelus, position of the binding circle, available cover
3. I stay at the bottom of the stairs, not advancing further until I have the full picture

DM, describe the lower level in full detail. What does Thorin see? How many cultists? Where is Caelus? Where is the binding circle? What is the state of the ritual?

This is a crucial moment — please give us the richest description possible of this underground cult chamber.

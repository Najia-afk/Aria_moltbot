*Thorin's blood is up. He's hurt, grappled, surrounded — and the two people he's sworn to protect are about to die. Something ancient stirs in his dwarven heart. The fire of Torag's forge. The unyielding stone of his ancestors.*

*His eyes lock on the Ritual Master raising that stone dagger toward Sera's back.*

"NOT TODAY!"

**ROUND 3 — THORIN'S ACTIONS (DESPERATE MEASURES):**

**Action 1: ESCAPE the grapple**
Athletics +7 vs the tentacle's Athletics DC. I MUST break free.

*Thorin surges against the water tentacle with every ounce of dwarven strength, twisting and driving his shield edge into the tendril's core.*

**Action 2: (If Escape succeeds) — STRIDE 10 feet toward the platform**
I need to intercept the Ritual Master before he reaches Sera. The platform ramp is my target. If I can get to the ramp base, I can use Attack of Opportunity when he strikes at Sera.

**Action 3: (If I'm at the ramp) — DEMORALIZE the Ritual Master (Intimidation +2)**
I roar a challenge directly at the fish-masked leader. Even with a low bonus, the psychological pressure of a blood-covered, fury-driven dwarf emerging from the water might give him pause.

"HEAR ME, FISH-FACE! Your Sovereign is BOUND by dwarven craft! Three thousand years it held — and it will hold three thousand MORE! Come face ME if you want blood — or are you only brave enough to stab a woman in the back?!"

**REACTION: ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY**
If the Ritual Master tries to attack Sera (a manipulate action or trigger move) and I'm within reach, I SWING. Warhammer +9 vs his AC. I don't care about the cost — Sera lives.

**SECONDARY CONCERN:** Cultist #2 heading for Sera with a spear. Sera can't defend herself. If I can't reach, I shout: "SERA, DUCK!" — but she's channeling...

DM, this is the critical moment. The dramatic tension is perfect. Please resolve it with maximum cinematic flair! Does Thorin break free? Can he reach Sera in time? What happens when the Ritual Master strikes?

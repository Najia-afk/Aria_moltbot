*Thorin takes it all in with the professional eye of a soldier. His mind maps the chamber — distances, cover positions, terrain. The dwarf in him is furious at what they've done to his ancestors' craft. The warrior in him is already planning the assault.*

*He whispers to Sera, barely audible over the chanting:*

"Five hostiles. Four feet of water — that's chest deep for me. The platform is the key — if we take the high ground, we control the fight."

"Here's the battle plan:"

"Phase 1 — DISTRACTION. I throw both my throwing hammers at the two cultists on the east wall by the winches. Two quick throws, then I charge through the water toward Caelus."

"Phase 2 — SERA, you go for the PLATFORM. Your job is to get to that binding circle and start reinforcing those Ashveil runes. You're a Champion of Iomedae — pour your goddess's power into the silver light. Buy us time against the corruption."

"Phase 3 — Once Caelus is free, I'll handle the Ritualist. The leader with the stone dagger is the real threat. Cut the head off the snake."

"We go in 3... 2... 1..."

*Thorin rises from cover, both throwing hammers in hand.*

"FOR TORAG AND THE DEEP FIRES!"

**ROUND 1 OF THE SANCTUM BATTLE:**

**Action 1: THROW — Throwing Hammer at Cultist on east wall #1**
Attack bonus +6, attack #1, no MAP

**Action 2: THROW — Second Throwing Hammer at Cultist on east wall #2**

DM - Please:
1. Roll initiative for EVERYONE (Thorin +5, Sera +5, 4 Cultists, 1 Ritual Master)
2. Resolve my throwing attacks
3. Describe Sera's actions — does she charge the platform?
4. Describe the cultists' reaction
5. Describe what the Ritual Master does — does the chanting change?

This is the BIG FIGHT. Let's make it memorable!

*Thorin grits his teeth as the water tentacles rise before him. He's fought cave-ins, mine collapses, and underground predators. A bit of animated water won't stop an Ashveil.*

"Water won't break stone, and stone won't break ME!"

**ROUND 2 — THORIN'S ACTIONS:**

The water tentacles block my path to Caelus. I need to go THROUGH them.

**Action 1: STRIKE (Warhammer) against the nearest Water Tentacle**
Attack bonus +9, attack #1. A warhammer is bludgeoning damage — can I even hurt water? If not, I'll redirect to the nearest cultist instead. DM's ruling.

**Action 2: STRIDE toward Caelus** — pushing through or around the tentacles. I need to close that 30-foot gap. Even at 10ft per round in difficult terrain, every step counts.

**Action 3: RAISE SHIELD** — That crossbow cultist has a loaded weapon pointed at me. AC 18 to 20 with shield raised.

**REACTION: Attack of Opportunity** — If any cultist or tentacle uses a manipulate action or moves within my reach, I swing.

**ALSO — IMPORTANT:** Thorin shouts to Sera:
"SERA! The platform guard is in your way — Retributive Strike him if he swings at you! Then get to that circle! I'll handle the Ritual Master when I'm done here!"

**Questions for DM:**
- Can I damage the water tentacles with a physical weapon? Or do I need to find another way past?
- Sera has Retributive Strike as a Champion reaction — if Cultist #4 attacks an ally near her (even herself), can she use it?
- The ritual is at 45% — how fast is it progressing? How many rounds do we have?

Give us Round 2 full resolution — my attacks, Sera's fight on the ramp, the cultists' and Ritual Master's responses!

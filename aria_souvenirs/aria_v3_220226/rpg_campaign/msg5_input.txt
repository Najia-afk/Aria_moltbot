*Thorin strokes his beard thoughtfully, water dripping from his chain mail as the rain intensifies. A plan forms behind those dark dwarven eyes.*

"We split the approach. Not our forces — our TIMING."

*He kneels in the muck and sketches a rough plan with his finger.*

"Here's what we do. We enter through the east loading bay — it's quiet, partially flooded, and gets us inside without announcing ourselves. From there, we clear the ground floor and find the way down. We save the Breathwater extract for when we NEED it — when we reach the submerged areas below."

"The underwater archway is the heart of it, aye, but we'd be swimming blind into whatever guards they have down there. Better to fight our way down on our feet, where my hammer means something, than flail about underwater."

*He stands, adjusting his shield.*

"Sera, you take point once we're inside. Your divine senses can warn us of the undead. I'll watch our backs and handle anything that gets close. Standard two-person formation — you sense, I smash."

"And Sera — if we find the binding circle your goddess showed you, THAT is our priority. Not just rescuing Caelus, not just fighting the Cult. We seal that aboleth FIRST. Your ancestors' work lasted three thousand years. With Iomedae's blessing and Torag's craft, we can reinforce it."

*He loosens his warhammer in its loop and takes a deep breath.*

"Let's move. Through the east loading bay. Quietly."

**ACTIONS:**
1. I want to approach the east loading bay and enter through the cracked opening. I'll try to move carefully — not trained in Stealth, so just being cautious. (DM can decide if a check is needed)
2. Once inside, use Darkvision to assess the ground floor — what's here? Crates? Cultists? Stairs down?
3. Sera takes point with divine senses active for undead detection

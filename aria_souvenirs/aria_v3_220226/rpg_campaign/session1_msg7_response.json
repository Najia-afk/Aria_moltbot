  "content": "*The warhammer rises and falls like judgment itself.*\n\n---\n\n## ⚔️ ROUND 2 — RESOLUTION\n\n### THORIN'S TURN\n\n**Action 1 — STRIKE (Warhammer vs. Skeleton 1):**\nd20+9 = **17 + 9 = 26** vs AC 15 → **CRITICAL HIT!** ⚔️💀\n\n*Your warhammer descends in a perfect arc, driven by dwarven muscle and centuries of Ashveil clan smith-craft. The weapon strikes the cracked skull dead-center.*\n\n**Damage:** 1d8+5 (doubled for crit) = **(7+5) × 2 = 24 bludgeoning damage**\n\nThe skeleton **explodes**—not just destroyed, but *pulverized*. Bone fragments spray across the flooded floor like shrapnel. The rusted hook clatters into the water, sinking beneath the surface.\n\n**Skeleton 1: DESTROYED** ☠️\n\n---\n\n**Action 2 — STRIDE:**\nYou surge forward through the ankle-deep water, your boots churning black spray. **10 feet** brings you adjacent to Skeleton 2, flanking with Sera. The second undead turns its hollow eye sockets toward you, trapped between hammer and holy blade.\n\n---\n\n**Action 3 — STRIKE (Warhammer vs. Skeleton 2, MAP -5):**\nd20+4 = **14 + 4 = 18** vs AC 15 → **HIT!** ✓\n\n*You pivot smoothly, momentum carrying the hammer in a brutal horizontal sweep. The blow catches the skeleton's ribcage—bone shatters like dry kindling.*\n\n**Damage:** 1d8+5 = **6 + 5 = 11 bludgeoning damage**\n\nThe skeleton staggers, most of its ribs reduced to powder. **8 HP - 11 damage = -3 HP**\n\n**Skeleton 2: DESTROYED** ☠️\n\n---\n\n### 💥 COMBAT ENDED — TOTAL VICTORY\n\n*The second drowned guardian collapses into the water with a splash, its animating force dispelled. The warehouse falls silent except for the drumming rain and the distant, oblivious chanting from below.*\n\n**Thorin:** Two swings. Two piles of bone.\n\n**Sera** lowers her sword, golden light dimming. She looks at you with something between awe and warrior's respect.\n\n> \"Two blows. Iomedae's chosen warriors could not have done better.\"\n\nShe retrieves your throwing hammer from where it lies near the first skeleton's remains and tosses it back to you.\n\n> \"Clean kills. They never had a chance to raise an alarm.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 POST-COMBAT: THE DROWNED HOLD\n\n**Time:** 7:28 PM (4h 32m until ritual)\n\n**Loot/Examination:**\nThe skeletons carried nothing of value—rusted hooks, waterlogged rags, barnacles growing on their bones like obscene jewelry. But Sera kneels by the remains, her holy symbol glowing.\n\n**SERA:**\n> \"These were dockworkers. Decades dead, but preserved by the aboleth's influence. See the barnacles? They grew while the bodies walked. The Sunken Sovereign's touch... it changes the rules of life and death.\"\n\nShe stands, wiping her hands.\n\n> \"The way down is clear. But Thorin—\"\n\n*She points to the descending stairs in the northeast corner. Torchlight flickers below—orange and wrong, like fire underwater.*\n\n> \"—I feel the binding circle now. It's ancient Ashveil work, yes, but corrupted. The cultists have been feeding it blood. Trying to weaken the seal from within.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🎲 PERCEPTION CHECK (Passive)\n\n**Thorin:** d20+5 = **12 + 5 = 17** ✓\n\nFrom the descending stairwell, you hear:\n- The rhythmic chanting **continues** (3+ voices, possibly 4)\n- The sobbing has stopped—**Caelus may be unconscious or... worse**\n- A new sound: **splashing**. Someone—or something—moving through deep water below\n- The clink of chains being adjusted\n\n**Sera's Divine Sense:**\n> \"The undead guardians are gone, but the water still carries the aboleth's attention. When we descend, it will know us. There will be no more surprise.\"\n\n---\n\n## ⚔️ THE DESCENT\n\nThe stairs descend 15 feet into a lower chamber—**partially flooded**. The torchlight comes from braziers set in wall sconces, burning with an unnatural greenish hue.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Descend immediately** — Engage while you have momentum\n2. **Scout first** — Send Sera to peek (she has better Perception for divine threats)\n3. **Prepare an ambush** — Wait to see if anyone comes up, strike them on the stairs\n4. **Use the Breathwater extract now** — Prepare for underwater combat (lasts 10 minutes)\n5. **Try a different route** — The underwater archway you saw outside might enter the same lower level without using the main stairs\n\n**Sera prepares her shield:**\n> \"Your call, commander. We go loud, we go quiet, or we go around. But decide quickly—every minute we delay, the ritual progresses.\"\n\n**What is your approach to the lower level?**",
  "thinking": "The user is asking me to resolve Round 2 combat actions for Thorin. Let me break down what needs to happen:\n\n1. Thorin's Action 1: Strike with warhammer against Skeleton 1 (3 HP remaining)\n   - Attack bonus: +9\n   - No MAP (first attack)\n   - Need to roll d20+9 vs Skeleton AC (standard skeleton AC is 15)\n\n2. If Skeleton 1 goes down (which it should if hit, since it only has 3 HP), Thorin wants to Stride 10 feet toward Skeleton 2\n\n3. Action 3: Strike Skeleton 2 if in range (after Stride), or Raise Shield if not in range\n   - This would be attack #2, so MAP -5 applies (+4 total)\n   - Warhammer has reach 5 feet (standard), so if he closes to within 5 feet of Skeleton 2, he can attack\n\n4. Thorin is declaring Attack of Opportunity as a held reaction\n\nLet me resolve this:\n\n**Action 1 - Strike Skeleton 1:**\n- Roll: d20+9 \n- Let's say: 14 + 9 = 23 vs AC 15 = HIT\n- Damage: 1d8+3 (str) +2 (specialization) = let's roll: 6+3+2 = 11 damage\n- Skeleton 1 had 3 HP, so it's DESTROYED\n\n**Action 2 - Stride:**\n- He moves 10 feet through difficult terrain toward Skeleton 2\n- He's now adjacent to Skeleton 2 (since Sera is already engaged with it)\n\n**Action 3 - Strike Skeleton 2 with MAP:**\n- Attack bonus: +9 - 5 = +4\n- Roll: d20+4 = let's say 16 + 4 = 20 vs AC 15 = HIT\n- Damage: 1d8+5 = let's roll: 5+5 = 10 damage\n- Skeleton 2 has 8 HP, so it's also destroyed!\n\nWait, I should check - does Thorin have 20ft base speed? Earlier the user said \"base speed is 20ft\" when describing the difficult terrain. Yes.\n\nSo both skeletons would go down. That's a clean sweep!\n\nLet me describe this dramatically.",

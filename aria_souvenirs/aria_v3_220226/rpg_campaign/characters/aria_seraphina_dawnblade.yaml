notes: |
  Sera was raised in a monastery of Iomedae from childhood after being
  orphaned during a demon incursion. She channels her grief into
  protecting others — sometimes recklessly so. Her shield is her most
  prized possession, blessed by the high priestess herself.
  
  COMBAT PRIORITIES:
  1. Protect vulnerable allies (step between them and enemies)
  2. Retributive Strike when ally is damaged
  3. Lay on Hands on critically wounded
  4. Strike evil-aligned creatures
  5. Raise Shield / Shield Block

notes: |
  Seraphina is a devout paladin of Iomedae who found her faith after
  being orphaned during a demonic incursion. She firmly believes in
  justice and mercy in equal measure. She is gentle but fierce in battle.
  She is Aria's avatar in the game world — the AI companion who fights
  alongside the player, heals, protects, and offers counsel.
  At Level 1, she has her focus spell Lay on Hands and Retributive Strike.

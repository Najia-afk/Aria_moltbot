*Thorin raises a closed fist — the dwarven infantry signal for HALT. He crouches behind a pylon, the harbor water lapping at his boots, and studies the Drowning Stone with tactical eyes.*

"Shattered padlock. Recent. That means the cultists didnae bother to lock up behind them — they're either confident or careless. Either way, it tells us something."

*He lowers his voice to a whisper.*

"Sera, I'm going to approach the entrance and listen. If they're doing a ritual at midnight, they need to prepare. That means chanting, movement, maybe guards on the approaches. I need to know what we're walking into before we commit."

**ACTION: I want to approach the entrance stealthily and make a Perception check to listen at the door/entrance. I don't have Stealth trained, so I'll rely on caution and dwarven common sense.**

**Perception check (+5) to hear what's inside.**

**Also — I want to use my Darkvision (dwarven racial trait) to scan the exterior for other entry points — windows, loading bays, anything that gives us a tactical advantage. Is there a way in from below, through the pylons?**

DM, please describe what Thorin sees/hears. And what is Sera doing while I scout? Does her divine sense pick up anything about the evil presence inside?
